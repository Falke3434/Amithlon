This contains programs to create (mkreiserfs) and repair
(reiserfsck) reiserfs file system on a block device.
 
IMPORTANT : reiserfsck and some others utils are broken now, 
            and will be ready in reiserfs-3.6.13

Building is simple: say
make


After that you have binaries in bin/.

You can `make install` to copy programs to /sbin
and man pages to /usr/man/man8.


NOTE: 	do not store data you take care about on reiserfs partition. It
	is quite unstable yet.  Please, report any weird behaviour ro
	reiser@idiom.com.


FSCK NOTE:
	Reiserfs stores data on disk in quite complicate manner. This leads
	that reiserfsck does not look as a simple program. It should
	still contain bugs. The perfect way to use it is to backup
	target partition first (I am sorry, if you have desire, time and disk
	space). If reiserfs will fail, it would be useful to use backuped copy
	of the partition in the debugging.

Thanks a lot
